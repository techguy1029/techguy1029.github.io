	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>
		I enjoy learning new technologies and being able to experiment with them. 
		Currently, I am learning C#. Programming is enjoyable to me because I love solving a good puzzle. And that's what programming feels like to me. 
		I plan on working in web development since I feel that a website is very important for anyone who wants to share something.
		Here are some technologies I have messed with:

	<p>
		In my spare time, which I don't have much of, I enjoy brushing up on some new technologies, video games, football(soccer), and I especially enjoy video games about soccer.
		Not to show off, but I am pretty good at FIFA.
